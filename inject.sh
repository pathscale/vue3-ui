# Additionally, if you wish to have available on such project components that are local
# Invoke this script with the name of such component and it will inject the latest bundle into that project

# For example
# ./inject.sh my-dev-environment
# will copy inject the latest local bundle into ../my-dev-environment/node_modules/@pathscale/vue3-ui/dist/
